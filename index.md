## 🧑‍🔬 Research Experience

### Institute of Condensed Matter and Material Physics

**School of Physics, Peking University**  
*2024*

- Working in Prof. Ji Chen’s research group, focusing on the research and application of the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method in computational physics.
- Developed a Python‑based KMC simulator to study physical systems at the microscopic level.
- Investigating the reaction mechanisms like the growth of species on substrates using machine learning potentials, which are models that predict interactions between materials based on machine learning.

### Intelligence Graphics Computing Lab

**Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University**  
*2023*

- Explored more in‑depth knowledge of computer graphics and machine learning in Prof. Zhouhui Lian’s research group.
